# CS304PC: COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND ARCHITECTURE

## Pre-requisite: 
- A Course on “Digital Logic Design and Microprocessors”.

## Course Objectives:
- The purpose of the course is to introduce principles of computer organization and the basic architectural concepts.
- It begins with basic organization, design, and programming of a simple digital computer and introduces simple register transfer language to specify various computer operations.
- Topics include computer arithmetic, instruction set design, microprogrammed control unit, pipelining and vector processing, memory organization and I/O systems, and multiprocessors
